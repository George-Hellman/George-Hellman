- 👋 Hi, I’m @George-Hellman
- 👀 I’m interested in seeking how to express humility, poverty, and disability, while feeling remorseful. Otherwise, one emits more GHG.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Golang, in order to write Hyperledger chaincode
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to DLT ("blockchain").
- 📫 How to reach me: hellman1519@yahoo.com
